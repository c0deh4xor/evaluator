implement ‘compiled’ version of expressions for better performance

a basic oscilloscope view for the gui?

feedback in the gui to identify syntax errors in the expression

support for multiple voices??

some number of sub-expressions?
- may not need this if expression can include subs as below.

volume as a knob

bit depth as number box with up/down arrows

different modes for when to reset t: 
- with every note on (as it does currently)
- follow project time (ie when note on is received set t to current project time in samples, increment from there)

figure out symbol to use for ‘triangle’ operator, maybe ‘V’?

support branching with ternary operator?
- eg: t%10 < 5 ? 0 : r
- if used outside of ternary t%10 < 5 should eval something useful. 0 and 1 are most obvi, but 0 and r-1 might be more useful.

support assigning new value to expression var from within expression? 
- eg: b={t*fn} | b*2, would be same as t*fn | t*fn*2
- or: @b{t*fn}, which is nice because @ immediately alerts parser that a var set is coming up, but doesn’t necessarily imply that it will also resolve to the value of b when the expression is evaluated.
