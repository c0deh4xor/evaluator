a basic oscilloscope view for the gui?

support for multiple voices??

some number of sub-expressions?
- may not need this if expression can include subs as below.

different modes for when to reset t: 
- with every note on (as it does currently)
- follow project time (ie when note on is received set t to current project time in samples, increment from there)

figure out symbol to use for ‘triangle’ operator, maybe ‘V’?

support branching with ternary operator?
- eg: t%10 < 5 ? 0 : r
- if used outside of ternary t%10 < 5 should eval something useful. 0 and 1 are most obvi, but 0 and r-1 might be more useful.

support assigning new value to expression var from within expression? 
- eg: b={t*fn} | b*2, would be same as t*fn | t*fn*2
- or: @b{t*fn}, which is nice because @ immediately alerts parser that a var set is coming up, but doesn’t necessarily imply that it will also resolve to the value of b when the expression is evaluated.

figure out a way to identify undefined variables when compiling? this may not be worth supporting.

maybe someday figure out how to embed this font for use in the interface: http://webdraft.hu/fonts/classic-console/

figure out how to set the cursor color in the mac textedit so it can be visible against the black background

figure out why the text in the windows textedit increases in size when clicked on for editing
